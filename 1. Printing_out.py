Q: 1. Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format (see the output).
Sample String : "Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are! Up above the world so high, Like a diamond in the sky. Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are"

All these are just me practicing for a better understanding for using Python.

print('When you start out, \n \t How boring the basics seems \n \t\t Came to learn how to code and make money, \n \t\t Not to learn more school work, \nWhen you start reflecting back how weird it seems \n \t Boring seems to be fun now')
