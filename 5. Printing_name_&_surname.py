Q: 5. Write a Python program that accepts the user's first and last name and prints them.

Haha now we at the basics of Hello World!
name & surname are the basic string type input and print is display.

I noticed with print if you use + there it combines the everything together;
e.g. 1+1=2 but for float and int values your need to use str(), otherwise with ,
it leaves a space between everything & does not need str() for float and int
it simple accepts; e.g. 1 + 1 = 2
"""
name = input('Enter your name - ')
surname = input('Enter your surname - ')

print('Good day to you,',surname,name)
